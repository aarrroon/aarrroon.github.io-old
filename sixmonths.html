                        Dear Catharine Xiao, 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        we have officially reached our six months anniversary, a big step in our lives !! I do not know about you but I am pretty proud of this accomplishment, and quite happy of this! Although we will be celerbating in person this special day at a different date, this day is still quite special. I apologise that we may not have the same persepctives in things or personality, but I hope that we will continue to care and love each other, because I really really love you and truely love you, even though I may not express it much. But the most important thing about couples is that they better each other, as they learn new things. And one such example is that I am slowly learning about other's needs and this allows me to become even more empathetic, so that not only will I be a really good friend or partner, but also a father (to <b>OUR</b> kids). But anyways back to our timeline:
        
                        
                        <br>

                </div>

                <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--4-col" ><img src="images/sixmonths/milk1.jpg" id="sixmonthimage2"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="mdl-grid">
                <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--4-col"><img src="images/sixmonths/img8 (2).jpg" ></div>

                    <br>
                    
                    Everything all started on the 2nd of May 2019 (totally did not make this date up), when Asher told you to call me a pedophile. This was a strange way for us to be introduced to each other but look how far from this we have become. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our friendship began to bloom even morewhen I replied to one of your stories on Instagram. After this day, I began to consider us as acquaintances which was really nice, as you seemed like a really cute friend to be around, like a little sunflower because you just look really happy !! But little did I know... ANYWAYS throwback to the GAT where this was when I considered you a really cool friend rather than acquaintance and from this point on, it was always a joy hanging around you. And all this lead to the 28th of October, where this was our first date AND KISS O:. 

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And from now on, was when you were the only thing keeping me going and studying for exam. Your back should be breaking from carrying my motivation to study, and I am grateful hehehe ilysmmm. But anyways this all leads to now!!!

                <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--4-col">
                    Now we are in the present, where I still REALLY LOVE YOU and this is our six months. I know I haven't been the best at making you feel secure but this is something I am going to learn with your help !!! and we shall always improve each other. But also I'm really thankful and grateful for you, because its kinda tuff having such a dumb fuck boyfriend and being the prettiest one in this relationship xd but my love for you does not falter, and I really do love you entirely. THIS INCLUDES when you fall asleep randomly, which used to confuse me, but as our bond got deeper I began to cherish it more and its something that makes our relationship unique and you're also just a really really cute sleeper hehehe and ur jsut cute in general. And also like you may think its superificial but I love how beautiful you are like its kinda amazing how people have to spend $50 each day just to look nearly as good as you which is kinda weird, because as soon as it rains poof they look like ur pinkie toe. But yea i really love you and I think i shall become THE BEST BOYFRIEND SOON HEHEEHEHEH BC IT FEELS NICE MAKING YOU HAPPY and i'm sad when i make you sad ;-; therefore i do not think i can be mad at you eva gg ): but again I really really love you my lil dozer bai bai <!DOCTYPE html>
